This is a React Tutorial
Study Notes:
A component takes in parameters, called props (short for “properties”), and returns a hierarchy of views to display via the render method.

The render method returns a description of what you want to see on the screen. React takes the description and displays the result. In particular,
render returns a React element, which is a lightweight description of what to render.

You can put any JavaScript expressions within braces inside JSX. Each React element is a JavaScript object that you can store in a variable or pass around in your program.

React components can have state by setting this.state in their constructors. this.state should be considered as private to a React component that it’s defined in.
